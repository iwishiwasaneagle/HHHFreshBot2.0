## ⚠ Deprecated - HHH banned this bot for spam ⚠
Allegedly they had their own version. I disagree, the newsletter utility was unique. Alas, without the ability to create posts there was no way to get new users and I lost interest in developing it. At it's peak, this bot had 500 users.

# HHHFreshBot2.0

A bot to curate the [FRESH] posts from /r/hiphopheads in the past week or day. It scrapes the posts every X minutes, ignoring those below Y karma. If a posts score is different it updates the sqlite DB. If a post is over Z weeks old, it gets deleted from the DB.
